# EcosystemSimulation by MoLo and SmomsTheAnt
Simulation of an ecosystem in Python.
2 species:
Hostiles & Passives
Both Species need food to exist.
Hostiles need 1 food to survive and 3 kills to replicate.
Passives need 1 food to survive and 5 food to replicate.
If 2 Passives aim for the saim food source they'll share.
If 1 Passive and 1 Hostile aim for the same tree the Passive will die, if the hostiles have more than 10 food.
If 2 Hostiles aim for the same tree both will die and it won't cost any food.
