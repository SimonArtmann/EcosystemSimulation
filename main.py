# 2 species: neutral; hostile
# neutral: 1 apple to survive, 3 to replicate
# hostile: 1 apple to survive, 3 kills to replicate
# 2 hostile on 1 tree = both dead
# 2 passive on 1 tree = share
# hostile attacks -> loses 10 apples
# every tree drops 1-7 apples; set number of trees
# set number of days running, after every day number of survivors is displayed
